DESCRIPTION

Mail::Maildir

A filesystem-level implementation of Maildir++ format for mail folders used by qmail, courier and others.  Useful
for scripting common events for Maildir++ mail deliveries, as well as managing the maildirsize file according to the
Maildir++ spec (http://cr.yp.to/proto/maildir.html, http://www.inter7.com/courierimap/README.maildirquota.html).
Useful for determining the validity of Maildir and Maildir++ folders.  Useful for validating message names.

This module is not like Mail::Box, which is primarily an implementation for mail reading (that is, Mail::Box
would lend itself directly to writing a Web UI for mail, for example).  In the context of Mail::Box, Mail::Maildir
would be more of a module one would extend to expose the functionality of maildirs *to* Mail::Box (which to my 
knowledge currently implements only MH and MBox formats for mail folders).  Thus, Mail::Maildir might be a useful
utility for those who would extend Mail::Box, or other mail reading clients.
